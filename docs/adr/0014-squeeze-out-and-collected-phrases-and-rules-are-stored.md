Two facts about an activation were only ever known inside the search. The
first is which SP phrase it squeezed out. The second is which phrases it
collected while Star Power was running. The display layer needed both, so it
rebuilt them from the chart. That is the same drift ADR 0011 and ADR 0013
closed for the deactivation node and the cap-clamp anchor.

A record also never said which rules it was analyzed under. Once the user's
rule choices moved into hydra_rules.ini, a record from before an edit would
have read Ready while holding answers to a different question.

## The decision

The engine stamps both facts at copy-out. `Activation::sqout_tick` is the deact
edge's `sqinout_time` when the path took the SqOut branch.
`Activation::collected_phrase_ticks` is every phrase tick the path crossed on
the SP track, recorded in `advance()` and trimmed back past the squeezed-out
phrase in `create_deactivated_path`. A late-SqIn phrase and a cap-clamped
phrase both count, because the gauge received them.

The pather stamps `HydraRecord::rules_fingerprint` with the fingerprint of the
rules the run used. The store writes it into the structure blob right after
the format version, so version and rules make one 12-byte head. That head is
what decides Ready, in C++ (`structure_is_current`) and in SQL
(`kRowReadySql`).

Blob format 6, path-node format 4 and path-structure format 4 carry the three
fields.

## No fallback

A record written before this build has none of the three fields. It reads
Stale until it is re-analyzed. Nothing reconstructs the squeezed-out phrase or
the collected phrases from the chart, and nothing assumes an old record ran
under the default rules.

A record analyzed under other rules also reads Stale. It is not deleted. When
the rules are switched back, it reads Ready again.

When hydra_rules.ini is bad, the GUI opens its store with
`core::kNoRulesFingerprint`, which no rules value hashes to. Every row reads
Stale until the file is fixed, so nothing is shown as Ready under rules the
user did not choose.

## What this costs

Every stored record reads Stale once, after the upgrade. Every edit to
hydra_rules.ini makes the whole library Stale under the new rules.

The search pays one arena push per phrase crossed on the SP track, per path.
The limit was 3% on hydra_bench's corpus timing (best of two runs each, cap 4
and Auto at depth 4). The change was only committed within that limit; a run
past it stops for the user's call, and no cheaper variant exists.

## Amendment, 2026-09-26: the Auto budget and the Auto ladder

The first version put every rules field into one fingerprint, so any edit to
hydra_rules.ini made the whole library Stale. Two fields were over-reach
(user decision 7 of the 2026-09-26 audit plan).

The Auto time budget is a wall-clock limit. Two runs under the same budget
can settle on different rungs on a busy machine, so the fingerprint could
never promise a repeatable answer for it. It is in no fingerprint now. It
also had two homes: the search read `SearchSettings::time_budget_s` while the
fingerprint hashed `Rules::auto_budget_s`, so a run with no budget still
stamped 120 s. `Rules::auto_budget_s` is now the only home, and nullopt means
no budget.

The Auto ladder only changes what an Auto run does. A record now carries one
of two fingerprints: `Rules::fingerprint()` (every rule except the ladder and
the budget) for a fixed-cap run, and `Rules::auto_fingerprint()` (that plus
the ladder) for an Auto run. The store accepts either (`core::RulesStamp`),
in C++ (`structure_is_current`) and in SQL (`kRowReadySql`, now
`IN (?, ?)`). A ladder edit marks only Auto runs Stale.

The fingerprint's text changed, so every stored record reads Stale once more
after this lands. It ships with the record-format bump of the same plan,
which asks for the same one re-analysis.
