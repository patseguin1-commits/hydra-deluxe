class ScoreGraph:
    """Description of a song in terms of pathing choices and outcomes.
    
    Consists of nodes representing timecodes for the song and edges
    representing either getting further in the song (advancing) or
    switching between inactive and active SP (branching).
    
    To that end, the nodes form two tracks: the normal track and SP
    track. There are only branch edges between the tracks where it's
    possible to activate (with a fill) or deactivate (run out of) SP.
    
    Edges store information about what is gained (mainly points and SP)
    from taking that edge.
    
    Advancing down a track gets further in the song and accrues points.
    Branching does not advance time, but possibly accrues features like
    backends which are specific to the act of toggling SP.
    
    Because "your current SP" isn't encoded on the graph, not every path
    through it is a valid path for the song. However, the graph contains
    all the info needed to go from start to finish while tracking sp, in
    order to explore valid paths through the song.
